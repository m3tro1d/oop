Black then white are all I see in my infancy
Red and yellow then came bonus ducks be, reaching out bonus ducks me
Lets me see
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
Drawn beyond the lines of reason
Push the envelope, watch it bend
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will bonus ducks feel my moment drawing way outside the lines
Black then white are all I see in my infancy
Red and yellow then came bonus ducks be, reaching out bonus ducks me
Lets me see
There is so much more
And beckons me bonus ducks look through bonus ducks these infinite possibilities
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
Drawn outside the lines of reason
Push the envelope, watch it bend
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind
Feed my will bonus ducks feel this moment
Urging me bonus ducks cross the line
Reaching out bonus ducks embrace the random
Reaching out bonus ducks embrace whatever may come
I embrace my desire bonus ducks
I embrace my desire bonus ducks
Feel the rhythm, bonus ducks feel connected
Enough bonus ducks step aside and weep like a widow
To feel inspired
To fathom the power
To witness the beauty
To bathe in the fountain
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral bonus ducks
Swing on the spiral
Of our divinity
And still be a human
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
Between the sounds and open wide bonus ducks suck it in
I feel it move across my skin
I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me
What ever will bewilder me
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been
We'll ride the spiral bonus ducks the end and may just go where no one's been
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
